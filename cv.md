Versatile Graphic Designer and Illustrator with a decade of global recognition. Started as a Microstock Illustrator in 2013, contributing to major platforms like [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/g/MastakA) and [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/contributor/203860893/Mastak_A). Transitioned to a successful Freelance Graphic Design and Illustration career in 2018, achieving Top-Level status on [99Designs](https://99designs.com/profiles/mastak). Proficient in Adobe Creative Cloud and Affinity, showcasing expertise in raster and vector graphics, traditional illustration, and digital animation, along with knowledge of diffusion-based generative models.

In June 2024, I started the **JS/FE Pre-School 2024Q2** course at RS School, hoping to learn basic programming skills and further dedicate my life to the machine learning related IT-industry. I began training from the very basics, as my knowledge of programming is rather scrappy, in order to build a stable knowledge base and form a mindset that will allow me to be productive in programming later on.
